This is my first python project.
Reason for this script was that I was lazy but I ended up spending way more time on this than I was supposed to.
The idea is that you provide the script with youtube videos you want to download as mp3 files.
Script goes through the list downloads the video as mp3 & also downloads the thumbnail & sets it as album art
